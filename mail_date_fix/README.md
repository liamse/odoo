# Date Fixer
A major problem in Odoo 7.0 is dates in "Chatter" part. This date after one week change to a long number that does not means to end user. 

![Odoo 7.0 Chatter with long number date](/images/chatter_date_before.png?raw=true "Odoo 7.0 Chatter with long number date")

After install this module dates shows as well as it expected.

![Odoo 7.0 Chatter with formated date](/images/chatter_date_after.png?raw=true "Odoo 7.0 Chatter with date format")
